# FaceRecognition
The study of recognizing someone by their face, expressions, and other
physical characteristics has exploded in prominence in recent years. Face
recognition technology is the subject of several studies in various
regions of the world, owing to its numerous applications in diverse
fields. Face recognition technology is primarily utilized in security
verification, including passport authentication, biometric authentication,
image processing, driver license verification, video surveillance, and a
variety of other applications. Although, reliable biometric identification
method already exists, such as the fingerprint verification and the retina
scanner, but still, face recognition is stillz a challenging problem to
solve and there is currently no full proof solutions that can claim it can
handle all the situations it may encounter. Because of the numerous
settings of the human face, face recognition system is always tough to
display an accurate solution. Due to some of these difficulties of the face
recognition problem, there are many different techniques. Furthermore,
the applications cover a wide range of scenarios.

•Setting up your Python environment for face recognition.
•Utilizing OpenCV for real-time video processing.
•Implementing face detection and recognition algorithms.
•Integrating the face recognition model into a real-time video stream.
•Building a simple graphical user interface for interaction.
